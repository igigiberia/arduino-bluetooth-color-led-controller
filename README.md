# This is Arduino Uno R3 Code for "Color LED Controller" App, on which I've tested
I am still adding some features, like turning off and turning on of the strip.
I am still figuring out how to achive brightness control from that app, or I may switch to different

# Devices I used:
Full Color RGB LED Strip Driver Module Shield for Arduino UNO R3 STM32 AVR 12VDC V1.0 For MCU System (same as Full Color RGB LED Strip Driver Module Shield for Arduino STM32 AVR V1.0 CF)
In future I want to adapt it to "Full Color RGB LED Strip Driver Module Shield for Arduino STM32 AVR 3.3V-5V" as my bluetooth device needs 5v pin from Arduino Uno R3 and I now have them connected on the same 5v pin which is not good, I have free 3.3v pin which I can use exactly for RGB strip controller, or another solution might be to change bluetooth, but let's see

# Anyways
I have to order them so it'll be delayed
I am also waiting for resistors, and have to find out how to control power from Vin, provided by some external power source (12v, I'll put Amperewise information later, but I had another one with 2A and it had some weird sound, not sure where from but it sounded like transformer was receiving huge load, so I put the one with less)
I have HC-05 HC-06 board, it was indicated both over it when I ordered, as I understood there was only mounted pin amount different for these two, so I got with more (still I think it's HC-05) and am happy as the extra pin served for configuration, like bluetooth name and baud rate for displaying messages correclty
